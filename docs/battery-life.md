# Battery life

When pressing key buttton and transmitting data, it consumes around 1000 uA. In sleep mode it consumes 20 uA. Good coin cell battery can have around 200 mAh. So 200mAh/20uA = 10000 hrs in deep sleep mode. 10000hrs > 416 days > a bit more than a year.

But in general cheap batteries will have less capacity.

Consumption can also vary on different boads. My measurements were made with nrf52840 dongle.
